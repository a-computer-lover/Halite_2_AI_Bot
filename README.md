# Halite_2_AI_Bot
First of all, Thanks for Two Sigma for creating this competition but it unfortunately finished so you can't join to Halite 2 if you hadn't but you can wait for Halite 3, you can find more information in their homepage: https://halite.io/
This was my first AI bot. Ships mine planets and defense itself if attacked.
Things I am going to say is for those who doesn't about Halite: 
You can run run_game.bat to play a game between 2 bots or you can run run_game2.bat to play a game between 4 bots. It will create a replay file where you can submit on https://halite.io/play-programming-challenge and watch the replay file.
Bot's rating is 36.7 and rank is 418. 
NOTE: hlt folder is default, I didn't make any changes.
